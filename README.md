# Absolutely_No_

Absolutely_No_ Pack currently contains:

1. Absolutely_No_Ants
2. Absolutely_No_Fungus
3. Absolutely_No_Triffids


This was not created to take anything away from how the base game was desgined to be played - but rather meant for custom runs (such as MA_Mod) where Triffids/Ants/Fungus can degrade the experience.


The general purpose is as a repository for storage, not necessarily upkeep or maintaining for future versions.

May expand this to include:

- Slimes / Slime Pits

- Mi-Go
