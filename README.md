# Absolutely_No_

Absolutely_No_ Pack currently contains:

1. Absolutely_No_Ants 🐜
2. Absolutely_No_Fungus 🍄
3. Absolutely_No_Triffids 🌱


This was not created to take anything away from how the base game was meant to be played - but rather it was designed for custom runs (such as MA_Mod) where Ants/Fungus/Triffids, or anything that mass spawns from nearby locations, can degrade the overall experience.

May expand this to include:

- Slimes / Slime Pits

- Mi-Go

The general purpose is as a repository for storage, not necessarily upkeep or maintaining for future versions.

Credit goes where credit is due:
